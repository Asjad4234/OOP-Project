Introduction:
The Greenhouse Management System is a software solution designed to streamline the day-to-day operations of greenhouse facilities. 
Developed using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, this system enables greenhouse staff to efficiently monitor and control crucial environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and light levels. 
By automating various tasks and providing comprehensive management tools, the system aims to enhance operational efficiency and optimize plant growth within the greenhouse environment.

Features:
Environmental Monitoring: Real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, and light levels within the greenhouse.
Environmental Control: Automated control of environmental factors to maintain optimal conditions for plant growth.
Plant Inventory Management: Tracking and management of plant inventory, including species, growth stages, and location within the greenhouse.
Task Scheduling: Scheduling and assignment of tasks such as watering, fertilizing, and harvesting based on plant requirements and staff availability.
Data Analysis and Reporting: Storage of environmental data, plant growth metrics, and task logs for analysis and generation of reports.
